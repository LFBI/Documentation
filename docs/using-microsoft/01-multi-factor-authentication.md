# Enable Multi-Factor-Authentication (MFA)

_How to boost your account security_

## What is Multi-Factor Authentication?

*Authentication* is a technical term that refers to the process of signing in
by proving your identity to a website or application.

The most common form of Authentication is the use of a username and password.
Ideally, only you would know this combination in order to gain access to your account.

However, this approach has some serious security vulnerabilities. Usernames are often
easy to obtain or outright guess. We also frequently use the same password for
various different accounts. So if one password is compromised, your entire digital identity 
becomes compromised.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) attempts to solve these issues by introducing an additional
factor in order to prove your identity. 

A great example is the usage of an access code which is sent to your mobile phone each
time you attempt to sign in. Not only does this add an additional layer of security, it also
serves as a notification every time someone attempts to sign in to your account.
