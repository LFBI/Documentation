_How to use 365 Connect to log in to MyLFBI_

## Understanding your student account

LFBI provides every student with a **Microsoft 365** account. This offers many perks for you as a student!

-   Your LFBI account is an email address. You can open that inbox at https://www.outlook.com.
-   Your LFBI account has access to online versions of the Microsoft Office suite of applications, such as Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. To use these apps, go to https://www.office.com.
-   Your LFBI account has online cloud storage with OneDrive. This is a great place to store your class notes and assignments. You can manage your OneDrive files at https://www.onedrive.live.com.
-   Your LFBI account is used to log in to our MyLFBI learning platform. All you have to do is click the **365 Connect** button to Single-Sign-On (SSO) into the website.

:::note 

Single-Sign-On (SSO) is when several different websites share one login service. So, when you log in to one website, that login is shared by all the other websites.

:::

At LFBI, your login is shared between MyLFBI and the Microsoft 365 services listed above. This means that when you are logged in to Microsoft 365, you can easily log in to MyLFBI. However, if you are not logged in to Microsoft 365, you cannot log in to MyLFBI.

:::info[KEY POINT]

You must log in to Microsoft 365 *first* in order to be granted access to MyLFBI, our school website.

:::

## Signing in to Microsoft 365

1.  Go to https://www.office.com.
2.  Click **Sign in** on either the top-right or the center of the page to begin the login process.
3.  Enter your username and then your temporary password from your Welcome email.
4.  Create your own password.
5.  When prompted, you should also provide a recovery phone number and email address.

:::tip

If you set up a recovery email or phone number at this point, you can visit Microsoft's self-service password reset if you get locked out of your account in the future: https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/

## Signing in to MyLFBI

Now that you have signed in to Office, you will be able to use **365 Connect** to sign in at MyLFBI.

1.  Go to https://www.mylfbi.org.
2.  Click **Log in** on the top-right of the page.
3.  Click **365 Connect (Current Student)** to complete the Single-Sign-On process.

:::warning

On the MyLFBI Login page, *do not enter your username and password again.* By signing in to Office first, you are able to use the **365 Connect (Current Student)** button to log in via Microsoft Office. (The manual username & password entry is a legacy feature used primarily by teachers, staff, and other non-student accounts.) If you attempt to use your LFBI.org credentials on the MyLFBI login form, you will get an *"Invalid login, please try again"* error.
