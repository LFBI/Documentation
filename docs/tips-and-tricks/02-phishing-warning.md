# Watch out for Phishing

_How to identify suspicious emails_

## What is Phishing?

_Phishing_ is when a bad actor sends you a fraudulent email. Here are some examples:
-   **It may be an attempt to compromise the security of your account.** The email might
    contain a link to a fake website that prompts you for your username and password. 
    Once they have this information, they will have access to your account.
-   **It may be an attempt to get you to download malware.** Attachments to the email or
    links to download a file may result in a virus compromising your computer.
-   **It may be an attempt to steal your money.** Perhaps the email contains an urgent
    request for financial help that is seeking to steal your financial information.

## How do I spot Phishing?

Here are some tips to identify potential Phishing attempts and keep your account secure:
1.  Always be hesitant before clicking a link or downloading a file attached to an email.
    Make absolute sure that the email is coming from a trusted source. Furthermore, you
    can hover over a link or button before clicking it, and the address will display
    on the bottom-left of the page. If the URL appears suspicious, don't click it.
2.  Watch out for emails that convey a sense of urgency. Many phishing scams will have
    very pushy language like "WARNING" or "ATTENTION" that call you to take immediate
    action. For example, it might claim to be notifying you that your access is expiring
    or your account has been compromised. They will say whatever they can to get you
    to download their file or click their link.
3.  Check for spelling mistakes or poor grammar. This is a frequent characteristic
    of phishing scams.
4.  Report phishing attacks to [Technical Support](mailto:rbagunu@lfbi.org). That way,
