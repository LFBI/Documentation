# Enrolling in your Courses

_How to enroll in your first classes_

## Consider the Program of Study

:::tip 

For a detailed overview of our Program of Study, please visit https://www.lfbi.org/program

:::

The Program of Study is broken down into three phases:
1.  Foundations
2.  Bible Essentials
3.  Leadership Prep

:::info

It is important to note that the three phases are sequential. **Foundations** courses are a *required* prerequisite before proceeding to the rest of the Program.

:::info

So your first enrollments should be one of the following:

### (1) Freshman Orientation

This is an 8-week course introducing students to LFBI, how it functions as an institution, and how to succeed academically. 

:::tip

It is highly recommended that you take Freshman Orientation during your first semester as a student at LFBI.

:::

### (2) Foundations 1

This is a 16-week course which is required only for students who have *not completed Biblical Discipleship* within their local church. If you have already been
discipled in your local church, you can skip this course.

### (3) Foundations 2 and/or Foundations 3

This pair of 16-week courses (previously termed Discipleship 2) are the final step of the Foundations track. They cover:
-   The Character Qualities of a Man or Woman of God
-   The Spiritual Qualities of a Man or Woman of God
-   The Seven Stages of Spiritual Growth
-   The Philosophy of Biblical Discipleship
-   How to Disciple
-   How to Study the Bible & Apparent Contradictions

:::tip

If you completed Discipleship 2 or a similar training in your local church, you can receive transfer credit by coordinating with your church to submit a syllabus and 
grade to LFBI. For more information, please reach out to the Registrar.
