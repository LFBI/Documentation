_How to use 365 Connect to log in to MyLFBI_

## Your LFBI.org Account

:::info

LFBI manages its user accounts via Microsoft. You must log in to Office *first* in order to be granted access to MyLFBI, our school website.

:::

LFBI provides every student with a Microsoft Account under the LFBI.org domain. This offers many perks for you as a student and for us as an organization!

Here are some things to know:
-   By logging in to Microsoft Office at https://www.office.com, you can access online versions of Office apps like Microsoft Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.
-   Your LFBI.org username doubles as an email address; you can access that inbox at https://www.outlook.com.
-   By logging in to OneDrive at https://www.onedrive.live.com, you have online cloud storage for your notes, assignments, and other files.
-   By logging in to [https://www.mylfbi.org](https://mylfbi.org/login/index.php) using the **365 Connect** button, your Microsoft Account becomes a Single-Sign-On for all these services in addition to our school website.

## Signing in to Office

Before you attempt to log in to our school website, you will need to log in to your LFBI Microsoft Account first.

1.  Go to https://www.office.com.
2.  Click **Sign in** on either the top-right or the center of the page to begin the login process.
3.  Enter your username then your temporary password from your Welcome email.
4.  When prompted, you should also provide a recovery phone number and email address. This is optional!

:::tip

If you set up a recovery email or phone number at this point, you can visit Microsoft's self-service password reset if you get locked out of your account in the future: https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/

## Signing in to MyLFBI

Now that you have signed in to Office, you will be able to use **365 Connect** to sign in at MyLFBI.

1.  Go to https://www.mylfbi.org.
2.  Click **Log in** on the top-right of the page.
3.  Click **365 Connect (Current Student)** to complete the Single-Sign-On process.

:::warning

On the MyLFBI Login page, *do not enter your username and password again.* By signing in to Office first, you are able to use the **365 Connect (Current Student)** button to log in via Microsoft Office. (The manual username & password entry is a legacy feature used primarily by teachers, staff, and other non-student accounts.) If you attempt to use your LFBI.org credentials on the MyLFBI login form, you will get an *"Invalid login, please try again"* error.
