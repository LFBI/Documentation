# Forwarding your LFBI Emails

_How to receive LFBI emails at your personal email address_

<ReactPlayer url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTklPXwJ9_Y' />

## Why Do I Need To Forward Emails?

Every LFBI student is provided with a Microsoft account. That account is also an email address which you can access on [Outlook](https://www.outlook.com).

By default, communications from your courses as well as announcements from the school are sent to this address.

_If you do not forward these emails to your personal inbox, you may miss out on important information!_

## How Do I Forward My Emails?

1.  Go to [Outlook](https://www.outlook.com) and sign in with your LFBI.org account
2.  Hit the Settings gear icon on the top-right of the page
4.  In the _Search Outlook settings_ search bar, type in "Forwarding" and click **Forwarding** from the results
5.  Hit the checkbox to **Enable forwarding** and input your personal email address
6.  Click **Save**
