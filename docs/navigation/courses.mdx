# Courses
Find your currently enrolled courses

## The Navigation Bar

To view a list of all courses you are enrolled in, you have two options on MyLFBI:
1.  You can go to your [Dashboard](https://mylfbi.org/my/)
2.  You can go to [My courses](https://mylfbi.org/my/courses.php)

Both pages will display a **Course overview** grid of all your courses at the top of the page.

There are four options for sorting/filtering at the top of the Course overview grid:
1.  A dropdown which defaults to All. The other options let you filter by the timing of the course (In progress, Future, or Past) and whether you have Starred the course or not
2.  A search bar which filters by course title
3.  A dropdown which defaults to Sort by last accessed. THe other option is to Sort by course name (in alphabetical order, ascending)
4.  A dropdown to view the courses as a Card grid, as a List, or as a Summary list with additional details

## The Sidebar on the Home page

On the [Home](https://mylfbi.org/) page of MyLFBI, there is a Sidebar on the right side of the window where blocks of Courses are listed by semester. This includes a list of courses in the current semester as well as a list of courses in the upcoming semester (as soon as enrollment is available).

This Sidebar may be hidden. If so, it can be revealed by clicking the grey Left Arrow (**\<**) on the top-right of the screen.

## The LFBI.org Courses page

The [Courses page](https://www.lfbi.org/courses) is updated to list all courses that are currently open for enrollment.
