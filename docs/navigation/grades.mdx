# Grades
How to view your current and past Grades

## The My Grades page

On the navigation bar for MyLFBI, you can go to **My Grades** to view a list of your enroll courses and your letter grade and percentage.

:::tip

The Grade-Point Calculation is listed on the [Policies](https://www.lfbi.org/policies) page of LFBI.org. For example, an A is 97-100, and an A- is 92-96.

:::

## Your Grades in a particular Course

At the top of any Course page, there is a Grades tab, which will take you to a **User report** that lists your grades sorted by assignment type (Quizzes, Essays, Exams, etc.)

:::tip

Different assignment types are weighted differently in the gradebook. You can refer to the course syllabus to see the value for each assignment type in a course, or check the percentage listed on your User report.
